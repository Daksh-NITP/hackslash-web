        Archeologists consider it as one of the strongest natural forts. A Descriptive List of Inscriptions in the Central Province and Berar – dated in Kalchuri Era 933 (1181-82 CE) gives a long genealogical list of the Kalchuri kings. It mentions that there was a king in the family of the Haihaya who has eighteen sons. One of them was Kalinga whose son Kamala ruled over Tummana. Kamala was succeeded by Ratnaraja I and later by Prithvideva I. Mughal emperor Akbar captured the fort in 1571 and Mughals ruled until 1628 CE. Chaiturgarh was constructed by Raja Prithvideva I.
